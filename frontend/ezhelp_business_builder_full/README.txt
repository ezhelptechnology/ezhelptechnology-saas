# EZ Help Business Builder (Starter Skeleton)

This zip contains a **very simple starter** for your FroBot + EZ Help Technology system.

## Server (API)

- Location: `server/`
- Tech: Node.js + Express
- Start:
  - `cd server`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`

API has a stub `/api/frobot` route that responds based on `step`.

## Client (UI)

- Location: `client/`
- Tech: React + Vite
- Start:
  - `cd client`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`

The UI shows a basic chat-style interface for FroBot that talks to the server.

You can merge this into your existing project or drop these folders into what you already have, then extend the logic and styling.
